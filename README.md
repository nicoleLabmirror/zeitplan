# App Zeitplan
## First app. Basic stuff to *learn* Python Django 
### Current features:

* Overview of all days
* Select a day
* Add a day
* Delete a day
* Edit time entry of a day
* Vote for time entry
* Change state of time entry
* Add a new time entry
* Delete time entry
* Add category for time entry
* Add time frame for entry
* Order time entries ascending

### Planned features:

* If no time is entered, use "None" or previos value
* Kind of an auto zoom (app looks super small on moble devices)
* Design is super ugly. html? css? D:
* Tests? ^^

### Error log

* Adding time frame leads to an error if only one time (start or end) is entered

### Refactoring / TODO

* Use generic views
* Streamline templates
