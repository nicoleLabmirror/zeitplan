# App Zeitplan
## First app. Basic stuff to *learn* Python Django 

### Planned:

* MY TEMPLATES ARE BAD AND I SHOULD FEEL BAD
* "Design" ...
* Tests? CI/CD? 

### Done ... sorta:

* Overview of all days
* Select a day
* Add a day
* Delete a day
* Edit time entry of a day
* Vote for time entry
* Change state of time entry
* Add a new time entry
* Delete time entry
* Add category for time entry
* Add time frame for entry
* Order time entries ascending

### Error?

* Adding time frame leads to an error if only one time (start or end) is entered

### TODO

* Use generic views
* Streamline templates
* If no time is entered, use "None" or previos value

# :-D
